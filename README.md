# Charting Novel Cellular Subpopulations in the Renal Cortex of Diabetic Nephropathy in a Mouse Model Through Single-Cell RNA Sequencing
Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is a prevalent autoimmune disorder character
ized by the destruction of insulin-producing cells, often leading to diabetic kidney
 disease (DKD). Despite extensive research, the cellular mechanisms underpinning
 DKD remain poorly understood. This study aims to elucidate the cellular het
erogeneity and specific cell populations involved in the renal cortex of diabetic
 mice using single-cell RNA sequencing.
 Kidney cortex cells from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mice and healthy
 controls were isolated and subjected to single-cell RNA sequencing. Statistical
 analyses were performed to identify distinct cellular subsets and evaluate changes
 in cell population dynamics. Immunohistochemistry and renal function evalua
tions via Masson and Hematoxylin and Eosin staining were employed to validate
 the sequencing data.
 We first identified 11 distinct cellular subsets within the renal cortex. Diabetic
 mice exhibited a significant increase in distal convoluted tubule cells compared to
 controls. Additionally, a marked decrease in immune-related cells, including T and
 Blymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages, was observed. Cell communication
 analysis highlighted the role of the VISFATIN signaling pathway, particularly the
 Nampt-Insr gene interaction, in the diabetic renal cortex.
 Our findings reveal a unique cellular and molecular landscape in the renal
 cortex of diabetic mice, emphasizing altered cell populations and signaling path
ways critical in DKD progression. This study enhances our understanding of
 T1DM-induced renal alterations and suggests potential targets for therapeutic
 intervention to mitigate kidney complications in diabetes.
